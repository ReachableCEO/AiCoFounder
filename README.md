# Ai CoFounder

## Introduction

As Chief Technology And  Product Officer of TSYS Group / soloprenuer , I am always interested in leveraging every asset possible, conserving capital and
having solid velocity multipliers. 

This repository captures my efforts at filling various VP roles using generative AI:

(Svp reporting to me directly)
(Vp reporting to corresponding Svp)

- SVpMarketing
- SVpSales
- VpSales(region)

- SvpProduct

- SVpEngineering
- VpHardware
- VpSoftare

(VP reporting to (currently unfilled, i'm the interim) Chief Operating Officer)

- VpCompliance
- VpPeople

I suppose this should be called "AI First Hires" but it's kind of a co-founder of sorts...

I am embarking on this journey in earnest 12/2. Stay tuned.
